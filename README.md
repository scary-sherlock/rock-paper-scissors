## How to Play 🥳

1. <b>Choose Your Weapon:</b> Select Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Choose wisely; your fate is in your hands! 🥴 (Remember, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats… well, your hopes and dreams if you lose!)

2. <b>Face Off Against the Opponent:</b> The computer will randomly choose its weapon. Will it be Rock, Paper, or Scissors? (Spoiler: It’s always Scissors! Just kidding! 😜)

3. <b>See the Results:</b> Will you emerge victorious? Or will you face the dreaded defeat? Either way, you’ll get a score update! 🏆 (And maybe a reminder that you should’ve chosen Paper instead of Rock… just like that time you chose the wrong Netflix show to binge-watch!)

4. <b>Play Again:</b> Feeling lucky? Hit the "Play Again" button and challenge your fate once more! Or just keep losing and blaming it on Mercury being in retrograde. We’ve all been there! 😂
